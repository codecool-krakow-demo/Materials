# Before you start coding

 1. Be sure your coding environment is properly set up (Python is installed and VS Code is configured)
 2. Think about your assignment - what you have to do? What Python elements will you use?
 3. If you are stuck don't worry - that's the naural state of all programers no mather their level. Just google your problem!
 
 
One more thing about googling - there is a very good site that provide help for all kind of programmers: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
Try to find solution there, and look for answers that have the highest points rates and are quite recent!
